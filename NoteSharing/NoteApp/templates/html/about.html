<h3 style="color:gold;">Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</h3>
<p>
In recent years, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science has gained presence in all areas of life. Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge, insights from heterogeneous data using artificial intelligence. This programme seeks to determine the importance of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and its real-time applications in all aspects of life.
</p>
<p>
Data science is a “concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods” in order to “understand and analyze actual phenomena” with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science. This a result of the contribution by the massive explosion in data and the growing need of the industries to rely on data to create better products. We have become a part of a data-driven society. Data has become a dire need for industries that need data to make careful decisions.
</p>
<p>
Artificial Intelligence makes the use of algorithms to perform autonomous actions. Artificial Intelligence is a collection of technologies that excel at extracting insights and patterns from large sets of data, then making predictions based on that information.
